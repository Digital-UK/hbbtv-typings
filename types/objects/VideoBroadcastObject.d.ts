            playback. Objects in this state may be buffering data in order to start playback.
            Control of media presentation is under the control of the application, as defined in
            annex H.2. The content of the video/broadcast object is implementation dependent.

            state regardless of whether the media is playing at normal speed, paused, or
            playing in a trick mode (e.g. at a speed other than normal speed). Control of media
            presentation is under the control of the application, as defined in annex H.2. The
            video/broadcast object contains the video being presented.
        - 3 stopped; the terminal is not presenting media, either inside the video/broadcast
            object or in the logical video plane. The logical video plane is disabled. The content
            of the video/broadcast object SHALL be an opaque black rectangle. Control of

        See section 7.13.1.1 for a description of the state model for a video/broadcast object.

        NOTE: Implementations where the content of the video/broadcast object is transparent in the
        unrealized state will give a better user experience than ones where it is black. This happens for an
        application with video in the background between when it includes a video/broadcast object in the page
        and when a call to bindToCurrentChannel() completes. Applications which do not need to call
        bindToCurrentChannel() should not do so. The current channel can be obtained from the
        currentChannel property on the Application object which is the same as that on the
        video/broadcast object under most normal conditions.

            channel and render the received broadcast content in the area of the browser allocated for
            the video/broadcast object.

            If the channel specifies an idType attribute value which is not supported by the OITF or a
            combination of properties that does not identify a valid channel, the request to switch
            channel SHALL fail and the OITF SHALL trigger the function specified by the
            onChannelChangeError property, specifying the value 0 (“Channel not supported by
            tuner”) for the errorState, and dispatch the corresponding DOM 2 event (see below).

            If the channel specifies an idType attribute value supported by the OITF, and the
            combination of properties defines a valid channel, the OITF SHALL relay the channel
            switch request to a local physical tuner that is currently not in use by another
            video/broadcast object and that can tune to the specified channel. If no tuner satisfying
            these requirements is available (i.e. all physical tuners that could receive the specified
            channel are in use), the request SHALL fail and OITF SHALL trigger the function specified
            by the onChannelChangeError property, specifying the value ‘2’ (“tuner locked by other
            object”) for the errorState and dispatch the corresponding DOM 2 event (see below). If
            multiple tuners satisfying these requirements are available, the OITF selects one.

            If the channel specifies an IP broadcast channel, and the OITF supports idType
            ID_IPTV_SDS or ID_IPTV_URI, the OITF SHALL relay the channel switch request to a
            logical ‘tuner’ that can resolve the URI of the referenced IP broadcast channel. If no logical
            tuner can resolve the URI of the referenced IP broadcast channel, the request SHALL fail
            and the OITF SHOULD trigger the function specified by the onChannelChangeError
            property, specifying the value 8 (“cannot resolve URI of referenced IP channel”) for the
            errorState, and dispatch the corresponding DOM 2 event.

            The optional attribute contentAccessDescriptorURL allows for the inclusion of a
            Content Access Streaming Descriptor (the format of which is defined in Annex E.2) to
            provide additional information for dealing with IPTV broadcasts that are (partially) DRMprotected.
            The descriptor may for example include Marlin action tokens or a
            previewLicense. The attribute SHALL be undefined or null if it is not applicable.
            If the Transport Stream cannot be found, either via the DSD or the (ONID,TSID) pair, then
            a call to onChannelChangeError with errorstate=5 (“unknown channel”) SHALL be
            triggered, and the corresponding DOM 2 event dispatched.

            If the OITF succeeds in tuning to a valid transport stream but this transport stream does not
            contain the requested service in the PAT, the OITF SHALL remain tuned to that location
            and SHALL trigger a call to onChannelChangeError with errorstate=12 (“specified
            channel not found in transport stream”), and dispatch the corresponding DOM 2 event.

            If, following this procedure, the OITF selects a tuner that was not already being used to
            display video inside the video/broadcast object, the OITF SHALL claim the selected
            tuner and the associated resources (e.g., decoding and rendering resources) on behalf of
            the video/broadcast object. 

            If all of the following are true:

            - the video/broadcast object is successfully switched to the new channel
            - the channel is a locally defined channel (created using the createChannelObject
                method)
            - the new channel has the same tuning parameters as a channel already in the
                channel list in the OITF
            - the idType is a value other than ID_IPTV_URI

            then the result of this operation SHALL be the same as calling setChannel with the
            channel argument being the corresponding channel object in the channel list, such that:

            - the values of the properties of the video/broadcast object currentChannel
                SHALL be the same as those of the channel in the channel list
            - any subsequent call to nextChannel or prevChannel SHALL switch the tuner to
                the next or previous channel in the favourite list or channel list as appropriate, as
                described in the definitions of these methods

            Otherwise, if any of the above conditions is not true, then:

            - the values of the properties of the video/broadcast object currentChannel
                SHALL be the same as those provided in the channel argument to this method,
                updated as defined in section 8.4.2
            - the channel is not considered to be part of the channel list

            the resulting current channel after any subsequent call to nextChannel() or
            prevChannel() is implementation dependent, however all appropriate functions SHALL
            be called and DOM 2 events dispatched. The OITF SHALL visualize the video content
            received over the tuner in the area of the browser allocated for the video/broadcast
            object. If the OITF cannot visualize the video content following a successful tuner switch
            (e.g., because the channel is under parental lock), the OITF SHALL trigger the function
            specified by the onChannelChangeError property with the appropriate channel and
            errorState value, and dispatch a corresponding DOM 2 event (see below). If successful,
            the OITF SHALL trigger the function specified by the onChannelChangeSucceeded
            property with the given channel value, and also dispatch a corresponding DOM 2 event. 

            @param channel The channel to which a switched is requested.
                If the channel object specifies a ccid, the ccid identifies
                the channel to be set. If the channel does not specify a
                ccid, the idType determines which properties of the
                channel are used to define the channel to be set, for
                example, if the channel is of type ID_IPTV_SDS or
                ID_IPTV_URI, the ipBroadcastID identifies the
                channel to be set.
                If null, the video/broadcast object SHALL transition to
                the unrealized state and release any resources used for
                decoding video and/or audio. A
                ChannelChangeSucceeded event SHALL be generated
                when the operation has completed.
            @param trickplay Optional flag indicating whether resources SHOULD be
                allocated to support trick play. This argument provides a
                hint to the receiver in order that it may allocate
                appropriate resources. Failure to allocate appropriate
                resources, due to a resource conflict, a lack of trickplay
                support, or due to the OITF ignoring this hint, SHALL
                have no effect on the success or failure of this method. 
                If trickplay is not supported, this SHALL be indicated
                through the failure of later calls to methods invoking
                trickplay functionality.
            @param contentAccessDescriptorURL Optional argument containing a Content Access
                Streaming descriptor (the format of which is defined in
                Annex E.2) that can be included to provide additional
                information for dealing with IPTV broadcasts that are
                (partially) DRM-protected. The argument SHALL be
                undefined or null if it is not applicable.

        The behaviour is defined in more detail in the description of the setChannel method.

        function specified by the onChannelChangeError property with the appropriate channel
        and errorState value, and dispatch the corresponding DOM 2 Event (see below).

        If the OITF does not maintain the channel list and favourite list by itself, the request SHALL
        fail and the OITF SHALL trigger the onChannelChangeError function with the channel
        property having the value null, and errorState=10 (“channel cannot be changed by
